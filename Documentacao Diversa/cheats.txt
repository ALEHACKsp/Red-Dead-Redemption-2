greed is now a virtue
abundance is the dullest desire
a simple life, a beautiful death
death is silence
history is written by fools
greed is american virtue
guide me better
make me better
i shall be better
i still seek more
i seek and i find
you flourish before you die
seek all the bounty of this place
be greedy only for foresight
you seek more than the world offers
you want punishment
you want freedom
you want everyone to go away
balance. all is balance
you revel in your disgrace, i see
virtue unearned is not virtue
better than my dog
run! run! run!
you want more than you have
you want something new
keep your dreams simple
keep your dreams light
the best of the old ways
my kingdom is a horse
the lucky be strong evermore
you are a beast built for war
would you be happier as a clown?
a fool on command
vanity. all is vanity
eat of knowledge
share
you long for sight and see nothing
